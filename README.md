# spotify_million
This is my attempt at predicting similar songs based on a Spotify playlist using machine learning (Tensorflow/Keras). More of a way for me to learn how to use pandas and TF. I spend tons of time looking for new songs and it would be nice to have something that could help me, especially with how bad Spotifys algorithim currently is.
